# images-as-signals
code and data for 'Intermediate Image Analysis - Images as Signals' workshop

This workshop covers the application of conventional signal processing techniques to digital images. It is geared toward those with low-to-moderate programming experience, but beginners should be able to follow along with the provided tutorial code and examples. Students will learn how to apply Fourier and Wavelet-based transforms to their images and how to use these transformations to perform common image analysis tasks.

Lesson material is found in the lessons/ folder.
